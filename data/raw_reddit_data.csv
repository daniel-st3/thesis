NVDA,wallstreetbets,Coreweave 9-19 $150 csps for 192k premium,"Wrote 30 crwv (coreweave) 9/19 $150 csps (cash secured puts) for $62/share premium and 1 crwv 9/19 $150 csp for $64.1/share premium. Max profit $192k, max loss if coreweave goes to 0 is $273k. The $192k premium and $465k “cash” are in money market collecting 4 percent interest, which will yield another $6,700 between now and 9/19.

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:

“The general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies’ collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.

Customers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.”

Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI. 

Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market. 

However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability. 

Best case scenario is that coreweave closes in the $150 range with high IV on 9/19 and I get to run it back again, while collecting more premium and interest.",19,27,2025-06-19 16:40:11

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off. Tesla stock dipped 0.6% in premarket action.",341,123,2025-06-17 15:19:56

GOOG,wallstreetbets,Reddit unveils AI-driven ad tools to help brands tap into user discussions,"June 16 (Reuters) - Reddit launched two new AI-powered advertising features on Monday aimed at helping brands drive greater engagement by tapping user conversations on the platform, the company said.

The company said its AI-driven tool, ""Reddit Insights"", would provide real-time insights to marketers for planning campaigns by identifying trends on the platform and testing campaign ideas.

It will also provide a feature called ""Conversation Summary Add-ons"", allowing brands to integrate ""positive"" user comments directly under the ads to show what they think about the ad subject.

Platforms such as Reddit, Snap (SNAP.N), opens new tab and Pinterest (PINS.N), opens new tab are leaning on AI-driven ad targeting tools to attract marketers in a fiercely competitive ad market amid economic uncertainties.
Reddit's announcement comes after WPP Media trimmed its forecast for global ad revenue growth to 6% from its prior target of 7.7% due to uncertainties related to changing U.S. trade policies.

Brands are expected to prioritize flexible ad contracts and accelerate the adoption of AI tools in ad production and user targeting, the media investment arm of ad group WPP (WPP.L), opens new tab said last week.

Last month, Reddit forecast second quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates, but CEO Steve Huffman said the company expected some disruption for traffic from Google search.
Reddit also launched new content moderation and analytics tools in March, aimed at helping people adhere to community rules and better understand content performance.

GOOG,wallstreetbets,$ACDC: Near-term 100 Bagger on Oil,"# TLDR: Calls on $ACDC (ProFrac). If Oil goes to $100 a barrel or higher, it will go up over 100%. I'm expecting the Oil Algos to cause a Squeeze.


(Beware this is likely regarded)

**Intro:**

I'm the one who made the discussion post about the **Strait of Hormuz**. Basically, I think the oil market is mis-pricing this **catastrophic event**. I'm sure we've all seen the headlines. JP Morgan's simulations show that oil could reach **$120-$130** a barrel. It may be unlikely, but I think the odds are **non-zero.** While it is illiquid, **Polymarket has it at a 34% chance** at the time of writing. If Israel hits **Kharg Island,** Oil will skyrocket. It's safe to say, you can't find lottery tickets with odds like that.. **If the Strait is closed, or is seriously threatened, this could be a generational play**.

Now, there are dozens of tickers that give exposure to this, but I'm a **GREEDY** fuck. Even if it's a long-shot, I want exposure to the **maximum possible lotto**. Out of all the possible tickers, **$ACDC** is my favorite. It could easily go up **200-300%** from here if Oil makes any sudden large moves..

# $ACDC: Why?

I'll keep it simple, please consult the Google charts:

https://preview.redd.it/ksp6jkzri77f1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=bebb4fc4156a1f6b4596379da269704db973c9ae

https://preview.redd.it/1j9m2idti77f1.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=32adad5615f27bb871a1e6687aad8e8c8ebdec37

Basically, **$ACDC** is highly correlated with oil prices. Instead of wasting our time putting it in my own words, here's what **Claude** says about their business model:

https://preview.redd.it/qimrp73wi77f1.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=4403470e8248a6a167f6f0f2d1c0d0499fb4b5db

One important thing to note is the business becomes profitable at **$80** a barrel of WTI. This goes up massively at **$90, $100**, etc. That's basically the gist of it. Now for the fun part..

# Why it will Moon More Than Others:

Out of all the oil tickers, this one has the best setup for a big move. Here is the [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACDC&p=d) Data:

https://preview.redd.it/356qfcfyi77f1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb497e4ed96f143eb23add87569e52d3d4312f67

* **Insider Ownership of 93.10%**
* **Institutional Ownership of 8.45%**
* **11.06m Shares Float**
* **Short Float Interest of 36.25%**
* **Short Interest of 4.01m Shares \^**

While surveying the dozens of tickers expected to move on oil going up, this one caught my eye. This mechanical setup lends itself to explosive gains. Based on the current option prices, this is a potential **100 bagger**. The price estimations for **$ACDC** at **$120 a barrel** put it over $20 a share.

The kicker is that if Oil makes an explosive move, **Algos will buy up these stocks like crazy**. It won't hold, but I think the Algos could easily send this stock to **over $30 a share**. The buying would be extraordinary. I want to take advantage of this..

**To be clear, Reddit will not move this stock**. This is all based on the price of oil. I just think the mechanical setup provides a nice lottery ticket in case of Oil emergencies. I plan to sit back and let the algos do their thing. I just expect this stock to jump much more than others on **the day of** an oil spike.

# Positions:

**This is a small position! It's just a lottery ticket**. Depending on the situation in the Middle East, I will buy more on expiration. If the stock goes over 20, the 12c will 100x!

10c Jun 20th .21 avg
12c Jun 20th .09 avg

(Note: This is not a reddit squeeze, this just has mechanics for a massive move from Algos. It stood out to me as the best mechanics from any of the oil plays. Also, this is not financial advice and is likely quite stupid.)

GOOG,wallstreetbets,NuScale (SMR): The nuclear plays that's actually not retarded,"
Listen up regards, I found something that might actually print harder than your wife’s boyfriend’s portfolio.

AI is literally melting our power grid. Every time you ask ChatGPT for feet pics, data centers burn more electricity than a small city. We’re on track for 80 gigawatts of data center demand by 2030 - that’s like adding 20 million homes to the grid. Microsoft, Google, Amazon. They’re all desperate for reliable power that doesn’t depend on whether the sun is shining or the wind is blowing.

Enter NuScale (SMR). These beautiful bastards are the ONLY company with Nuclear Regulatory Commission-approved small modular reactor designs in America. Not “planning to get approved” or “working on it” - actually approved and ready to build. While other nuclear startups are still playing with PowerPoint presentations, NuScale has real reactors being manufactured by Doosan in South Korea.

Here’s where it gets spicy. CEO John Hopkins isn’t some random suit - this guy is Vice Chair of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and serves on the National Petroleum Council. When you’re advising the Secretary of Energy and rubbing shoulders with every major industrial player in America, deals tend to happen. Hopkins has explicitly stated they have NDAs with 5 “tier-one hyperscalers.” That’s code for the biggest tech companies on Earth.

The stock broke out of a 2-year base and is showing every technical signal imaginable. Golden crosses on multiple timeframes, held $40 support through heavy selling, and here’s the kicker - the options chain was capped at $50 until yesterday (now it's $60). When market makers cap strikes that aggressively on a volatile stock, they’re telegraphing where it’s headed. They don’t want retail getting 10x leverage to $100.

The real tell? Free float is still under 50% after a massive rally. Over half the shares are locked up by insiders and institutions who aren’t selling at these levels. When a stock has rallied 40% and insiders still won’t take profits, they know something we don’t. The float is so tight that when news drops, this thing will gap up violently.

The setup is perfect. The government needs domestic energy production for national security. Big Tech needs baseload power for AI supremacy. The military wants SMRs for bases and forward operations. Every major trend points to nuclear, and SMR is the only approved player at the table. When the first hyperscaler deal announces, we’re looking at an instant revaluation to $60+. When multiple deals hit, $100 isn’t a meme.

Risk is maybe 20% downside if deals take longer than expected. Upside is 2-5x in the next 12 months. In this market, that’s about as asymmetric as it gets.

Not financial advice, I just think atoms are neat and my nuclear engineering degree is from YouTube University.

Positions attached.

PYPL, because Elon lost like 25% of his net worth doing political stuff, he will look for other avenues to get quick gains, I think he still owns quite a bit of PayPal, and in addition PayPal just scored a big partnership (I forget who with, I only read the headline and saw green %). PayPal is a super under priced stock from what I understand, it’s always beating expectations and has a solid credit system and good consumer trust. I use it a lot, and I like betting on companies that I use.

SNAP, because I think they have a mystery under the hood that they have not yet revealed. They are still hiring AI/Tech recruiters, which means either they are dumb, or they expect to do a lot of hiring in that space and are willing to compete for the talent. They could be like a Reddit type stock, where the value comes from the user data that can be harvested for AI purposes. Idk I think they’re worth way more than $8 a share, based on their data alone.

META,wallstreetbets,$TMC: Trumps Executive Order Makes Deep Sea Mining The Next Big Thing With 16 Trillion Dollars Worth Of Untapped Minerals,"**TLDR:** Deep Sea Mining is rapidly becoming a major industry, tapping into an estimated $16–20 trillion in untouched minerals. Geopolitical pressures, particularly with China, and the need for critical rare earth minerals have pushed the administration to initiate entry into this sector. **As the industry now is transitioning from exploration to commercialization, investing in this sector in my opinion is equivalent to investing in the Texas Oil Company in 1902 and is a once in a generation 10-50× play or Flop depending on how Things pan out... $TMC Stock Currently has the first mover advantage.**

**Edit TLDR addressing Environmental Concerns in comment section:** These metals are essential—we're going to mine them one way or another. Harvesting them from deep-sea nodules is simply far less destructive than tearing apart forests, polluting rivers, or exploiting child labor on land. **The need is non-negotiable; choosing the cleaner, safer, and more humane/ethical source should be too.** Years of endless environmental red tape and political arguments put American innovation on hold while other countries raced ahead.

# A Market Worth Trillions Waiting to be Capitalized

Deep sea mining is a new industry **unlocking roughly $16–20 trillion worth of metals** that are still sitting untouched on the ocean floor. The first big prize sits in the Pacific: potato sized nodules scattered across the seafloor. Each nodule is packed with four easy‑to‑lift metals—**manganese, nickel, copper, and cobalt**—ingredients for everything from stainless steel and power cables to wind‑turbine parts and the latest battery chemistries. After the nodules, miners can chase crusts on undersea mountains loaded with rare earths and **titanium, sulfide mounds along mid‑ocean ridges rich in zinc and gold,** and thick beds of **phosphate** that are vital for fertilizer. Even a small slice of these deposits could reset global supply chains and tilt the strategic balance.

# Why This Matters Now More Than Ever?

For decades deep‑sea mining stayed stuck. The tools to dig four miles down did not exist, and a global deal called the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) said no one could mine until countries wrote the rules together. **The United States never signed that treaty, so U.S. firms were sidelined. On 24 of April, a new executive order signed by Trump flipped the script: it told American agencies to give out their own seabed permits and get moving.** With China controlling many land‑based metals, Washington now sees the ocean floor as the backup supply. **That switch—from “wait” to “go”—is what makes this moment urgent.**

# The Next Sector To Fly After AI and Quantum?

This sector just jumped from Exploration to initiation of Commercialization. The executive order threw open the doors, and the mining tech that engineers have been refining for a decade is finally cleared for action. **This setup for me feels exactly like the early days of AI or quantum Mania... For me, it's like buying into the Texas Oil boom back in 1902**: the ground floor, before drills hit pay dirt. With the tools tested, the permits coming, and demand for these metals only climbing, deep‑sea mining is starting its own gold‑rush moment...

# $TMC: First Mover Advantage

TMC (The Metals Company) has spent more than a decade quietly gearing up for this moment. Since 2011 the team has mapped the richest nodule fields in the Clarion‑Clipperton Zone, partnered with heavy‑hitters like Allseas to build a full‑scale collector ship, and filed mountains of environmental data. What held them back wasn’t technology—it was red tape. Until now they needed the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to finish its rulebook. On 29 of April, it filed the **first‑ever** U.S. applications for two exploration licences and a commercial recovery permit under the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act. **NOAA formally logged the filings for a completeness check on May 30** and launched a 60‑day clock to decide whether the applications meet all baseline requirements before a full technical and environmental review begins. At this pace, if everything goes according to plan, TMC could be clearing nodules **flying a U.S. flag even before the ISA finishes arguing over global rules.**

Moreover, China is not as advanced technologically as The Metals Company. ""I would characterize China as being two to four years behind them in terms of their technology,"" said Alex Gilbert of the Payne Institute, Colorado School of Mines.

# Edit: Addressing Environmental Concerns in the comment section

TMC isn’t rushing in blind. Over the last ten years they’ve run 22 research trips, grabbed loads of data, and put most of it online for anyone to check. In a 2022 test, the stirred-up mud hugged the seafloor and settled fast. A peer-reviewed study says metals from these seabed rocks could **cut the carbon footprint by about half compared with digging on land. There’s no blasting, no giant waste pond, and no acid runoff because the rocks come up loose.**

Plus, the nodule plains they’re working on sit **four miles down in what scientists call an “abyssal desert.”** It’s cold, dark, and food-poor, so biomass is tiny—far less life per square meter than on a coral reef or even a coastal seafloor. **That means less habitat disruption per ton of metal compared with ripping up tropical rain forests or river valleys on land.**

**Land mining often tears down forests, drains rivers, and leaves huge tailings piles that can leak for decades.** It also pumps out far more CO₂ because trucks, explosives, and smelters run nonstop. Meanwhile, big land-based **miners—especially nickel and cobalt producers in Indonesia and companies that buy cobalt from small mines in central Africa—have been pressuring their governments and the ISA to slow ocean mining since cheaper seabed metals would slice into their profits. Some of those same land mines have been tied to harsh, unsafe conditions and even child labor. If deep-sea metals can replace minerals dug by kids in dangerous pits, cut carbon by half, avoid wrecking forests, and disturb a sparsely populated deep-sea plain instead of a jungle, that sounds like a clear win to me.**

Endless “green tape,” court fights, and stop-sign politics in the last administration pushed U.S. projects years behind. While Washington argued over climate talking points and the Green-New-Deal crowd blocked permits on land **and** sea, other countries kept drilling, digging, and patenting the gear we now need. **If we keep treating every new resource project like it’s the end of the world, we’ll hand the entire supply chain to China—again.** The new executive order finally cuts through that clutter, but only if we ignore the same old scare tactics and get moving.

What are your thoughts regards? That’s my read and might be totally wrong: deep‑sea mining is about to rewrite the playbook for critical minerals and for me looks like a once in a generation 10-50×‑upside play that could lock in U.S. leadership on critical minerals Or a complete flop and could crash and burn lol.

MSFT,stocks,MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity,"According to the Financial Times Microsoft may terminate ongoing talks to deepen its partnership with OpenAI citing unresolved disputes over governance and future equity structure

The core issue OpenAI is pushing to formally transition into a for-profit entity which could potentially dilute Microsoft influence and ownership stake in the company  especially concerning any future models beyond GPT-4

Sources say that unless key terms are agreed upon Microsoft is ready to fall back on its existing commercial agreement which guarantees access to OpenAI models through 2030  unless a competitor matches or exceeds Microsoft's deal

Another twist OpenAI transition plan reportedly needs Microsoft formal approval by Dec 31, 2025. Without that green light OpenAI may risk losing interest from outside investors like SoftBank and other late-stage capital.

Despite the headlines, Microsoft commercial use case remains protected in the shorttomid term. But the question now is who controls the roadmap to GPT-5 and beyond  and whether Microsoft sees enough ROI to keep playing ball.

Is MSFT losing strategic leverage here? Or are they just protecting their current ROI？Could this open the door for Google, Amazon, or even Meta to get in bed with OpenAI?How would a fractured OpenAI impact Azure’s AI moat vs AWS and GCP?MSFT may terminate expanded OpenAI deal as tensions rise over control and equity

NVDA,stocks,That moment when your indicator finally signals... after the move is over,"You know that feeling when RSI finally hits ""overbought"" and you short... then watch the stock rip another 20%? Or when MACD crosses bearish after the stock already tanked?

I swear half my losses came from indicators that need a week to tell me what happened yesterday. By the time they ""confirm"" anything, the real money's already been made by someone else.

The whole thing is backwards. These indicators use moving averages - they're literally designed to be slow. Waiting for pivot confirmations, crossing signals, divergence ""proof""... meanwhile the stock's already moved 10%.

I have been working on reading momentum differently. Instead of averaged prices over X periods, just watching the actual fight between buyers and sellers as it happens. Like, are buyers getting exhausted RIGHT NOW, not 5 bars from now.

NVDA at $95 was a perfect example. Every traditional indicator said ""wait for confirmation."" But the real-time action was screaming that sellers were done. Next thing you know it's at $145.

That 52% move? Most of it happened while traditional indicators were still ""waiting for confirmation.""

Same story everywhere - SPX reversals, individual stocks, commodities. The exhaustion shows up immediately if you know what to look for. Not after the fact, not next week, but right when it matters.

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

GOOG,stocks,"Meta to release smart glasses with Oakley and Prada, extending Luxottica partnership","Meta and EssilorLuxottica plan to release versions of their AI-powered smart glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands, CNBC has learned.

The addition of Prada and Oakley underscore the breakout success Meta had with its second-generation Ray-Ban glasses released in partnership with Luxottica in 2023. The Oakley expansion will be done in partnership with Luxottica, while the addition of Prada signifies Meta’s first step toward bring its wearable hardware to more fashion companies. 

Meta on Monday teased the Oakley release on social media, launching an Instagram account for “Oakley | Meta” with a profile description that reads “The next evolution is coming on June 20.”

CNBC reviewed a document that says the new glasses with Luxottica will be aimed at athletes. Meta is targeting active consumers after seeing several owners of its Ray-Ban glasses use the device to record themselves playing tennis, skiing and doing other activities.

The Oakley version of the glasses may cost around $360 as they are more weather resistant than their Ray-Ban counterparts, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly about the upcoming device. The first version of the Oakley Meta glasses will feature similar technology to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses released in 2023.

Luxottica, based in France and Italy, has licensing arrangements with over 150 brands and owns notable brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear and Persol.

Meta’s agreement with Prada comes after the fashion company in December renewed an eyewear-related licensing agreement with Luxottica for 10 years. That deals covers the “development, production and worldwide distribution of eyewear under the Prada, Prada Linea Rossa and Miu Miu brands,” the companies said at the time.

Besides giving Meta a high-end partnership, the Prada glasses may be a particularly good fit for the tech company as many of the brand’s models come with thick temples, former Meta employees said. That provides more heft for housing many of the components necessary for smart glasses, including microphones and chips.

It’s unclear when the Prada deal and product line will be announced.

Meta first partnered with EssilorLuxottica in 2019 to jointly develop the Ray-Ban glasses. The two companies released the first version in 2021, but they found success after the release of the second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses in 2023. That version comes equipped with the Meta AI voice assistant and includes features and, when tethered to a smartphone, lets users identify city landmarks, get recipes when looking at ingredients and record and send voice messages on WhatsApp and Messenger.

EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February the companies have sold 2 million pairs of the Meta Ray-Ban glasses since 2023. Miller said he aimed to increase annual production to 10 million units by the end of 2026.

Meta and Luxottica announced an extension of their partnership in October, with plans to release more versions of their Ray-Ban glasses. That deal was worth $5 billion, according to a July 2024 report in The Wall Street Journal. As part of the deal, Meta gets exclusive rights to Luxottica’s brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. 

The two companies plan to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, CNBC has previously reported.

Competition in the market is heating up.

Last month, Alphabet announced a $150 million partnership with Warby Parker that will see the two companies team up to release glasses infused with Google’s Gemini AI assistant. The companies plan to release the glasses sometime after 2025. 

Snap, meanwhile, announced in June that it plans to release its sixth generation smart glasses under a new brand called Specs. Those glasses, expected for release in 2026, will include augmented-reality technology and will be smaller and lighter than Snap’s prior products, Snap said. 

Meta declined to comment. Luxottica and Prada could not be reached.

Bloomberg News first reported about the Oakley Meta glasses in January.

However, management is facing a declining moat from the disruptive growth of artificial intelligence in the hardware space, which poses a price-return risk.

META,stocks,US and UK say they’ve cemented a trade agreement that Trump calls fair for both nations,"No paywall: [https://apnews.com/article/trump-starmer-trade-deal-beef-g7-52bea5eb383a0b45d0d83e1982d277bf](https://apnews.com/article/trump-starmer-trade-deal-beef-g7-52bea5eb383a0b45d0d83e1982d277bf)

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they’d struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

Starmer said Monday that the trade agreement is “in the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.”

Trump said the deal is “gonna produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.”",540,96,2025-06-16 23:43:50

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares popped nearly 10% to lead S&P 500 gainers Monday as Piper Sandler analysts raised their price target for the stock coming out of the chipmaker's ""Advancing AI"" event. 

Piper raised its target to $140 from $125 and maintained an ""overweight"" rating for AMD stock. Shares of AMD were at about $127 in recent trading, making Piper's target a roughly 10% premium. 

The analysts came away ""enthused"" by the firm's newly unveiled Helios server rack architecture, which it called ""pivotal"" for the growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Helios will combine next-generation AMD MI400 chips into one larger system, the company said, and is expected in 2026. 

AMD highlighted its partnerships with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Meta Platforms (META), Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), and others at the event. Bank of America analysts believe there’s another high-profile partner announcement to come: Amazon (AMZN).

META,stocks,"WhatsApp to Show Ads, Offer Paid Subscriptions for First Time","Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. will begin showing ads inside of its WhatsApp messaging service, opening a new potential revenue stream while the company invests heavily in artificial intelligence and other long-term projects. 

The ads will appear in WhatsApp’s “Updates” tab, a section of the app that’s separate from a user’s inbox and private conversations. The tab gets 1.5 billion visitors per day, Meta said Monday. That tab is home to Status, WhatsApp’s version of disappearing Stories, which will now carry ads.

Advertisers can also pay to promote their WhatsApp Channel and give it prominent placement within the Updates tab. Channels allow brands or celebrities to post to a group of followers, like a giant email blast. 

As part of the advertising push, WhatsApp will also let Channel operators sell subscriptions, meaning they can create special messages just for a group of paying customers. Meta won’t take a cut of any subscriptions sold through the app at launch, but eventually plans to charge 10% of sales, Alice Newton Rex, vice president of product at WhatsApp, said in an interview. 

Meta has been spending aggressively this year on AI, including to improve the large language models that underpin generative AI features in its products. The company also just agreed to invest $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale AI, an AI data labeling startup, according to a person familiar with the deal. The expense has added pressure on Meta’s main advertising business to continue growing to support the expanding AI effort. 

The company has spent years slowly developing a business to accompany the private messaging service acquired for $19 billion in 2014. Advertising has never been considered a great fit given the intimacy of a private messaging inbox. Meta instead built WhatsApp to cater to small businesses, including efforts to build out digital payments and shopping features. Those services have been targeted especially in countries outside the US, such as India and Brazil, where the WhatsApp is the dominant messaging app. 

While payments, in particular, has been a slow moving effort given various regulatory concerns, Meta makes billions of dollars each year selling click-to-message ads on Instagram and Facebook that send users to a WhatsApp chat conversation with the advertiser. It also allows businesses to pay to reach customers on the app who have opted to receive their direct messages. 

Part of Meta’s challenge historically has been balancing the desire to generate revenue with a desire to give WhatsApp users privacy. Meta’s other advertising products are hyper-targeted and often rely on a user’s personal information or browsing history. WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted, and user privacy was a major promise from co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who pledged they would never sell ads inside WhatsApp. They left Meta in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

WhatsApp ads will use broad, general targeting like a user’s location, language preferences, and Channels that they follow, Newton Rex said. Meta won’t take a person’s Facebook or Instagram information to target them with ads on WhatsApp unless they’ve explicitly linked their accounts, she added. 

“We’re not going to interrupt people’s personal messages with ads,” Newton Rex said. “If you just want to carry on using WhatsApp for messaging and calling then you’ll never see them at all.”

WhatsApp will begin a global rollout of ads beginning Monday, but it will take time for all users to start seeing them, she added. ",115,95,2025-06-16 15:14:18

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for trade developments as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It’s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after May inflation data came in lower than economists expected. Despite comments from President Donald Trump urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will provide more insight into the central bank’s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday’s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is well-positioned to lead the market in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar’s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's warning of weakness in the housing market in the prior quarter.  The scheduled Friday reports from accounting firm Accenture (ACN) and online car seller CarMax (KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.

META,stocks,Convince me not to go deep into SNAP,"Believing the future is wearables AR and will replace phones. Is there a better positioned company that still has massive 100x potential than SNAP?

Snapchat leads in social AR, engaging 850 million monthly users, primarily Gen Z and Millennials. Its AR Lenses, used by 250 million daily, offer 600,000+ filters via Lens Studio, outpacing competitors in creative, social-focused AR. Snapchat’s Stories, disappearing in 24 hours, drive authentic, pressure-free sharing. Features like Snap Maps and Bitmoji games enhance user interaction. Snap’s Specs, set for a 2026 launch, aim for lightweight, standalone AR glasses, leveraging $3 billion in AR investment. Despite $4.6 billion revenue and $1.3 billion net loss, Snap’s first-mover edge over Meta’s 2027 AR glasses positions it to lead the mobile-to-wearables shift.

META,stocks,"Swedish pension fund blacklists Tesla, divests stake","June 13 (AFP) -- Swedish pension fund AP7 said Friday it had blacklisted Tesla over the US company's lack of respect for labour rights in the US, and had sold off its $1.4 billion stake in the US carmaker.
The fund said in a statement that it had decided ""to blacklist Tesla due to verified violations of union rights in the United States.""
""Despite several years of dialogue with Tesla, including shareholder proposals in collaboration with other investors, the company has not taken sufficient measures to address the issues,"" the fund said.
AP7 spokesman Mikael Lindh Hok told AFP the fund had divested its entire stake, worth 13 billion kronor ($1.4 billion), in late May.
He said the stake represented one percent of the fund's total assets.
The electric carmaker has also been involved in a labour dispute with Swedish unions since 2023.
In late October of that year, the metal workers union IF Metall launched a strike against Tesla over its refusal to sign a collective wage agreement, and some 130 mechanics at 10 Tesla repair shops in seven cities walked off the job.
IF Metall then extended the strike to include work on Teslas at other repair shops which served multiple brands.
The strike then grew into a larger conflict between Tesla and almost a dozen unions seeking to protect Sweden's labour model, including postal workers, dock workers and even spreading to neighbouring Nordic countries.
Tesla chief Elon Musk has long rejected calls to allow the company's employees worldwide to unionise.
Musk's close cooperation with US President Donald Trump has also led to calls for boycotts against Tesla.",1955,129,2025-06-13 16:54:46

NVDA,stocks,All time highs on the horizon,"Nvidia Corporation is attractively valued and its strong EPS growth and profitability outpacing peers make it a compelling entry point. AI-driven demand from hyperscalers and new sovereign deals (UAE, Saudi Arabia) provides long-term headroom for continued growth. Despite the loss of China revenues and recent price stagnation, NVIDIA's fundamentals remain strong and its market leadership unquestioned. I am upgrading my rating on NVDA stock to Strong Buy, believing it is capable of delivering superior returns and has the potential to reach a $10 trillion valuation.



When I looked at NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) late last year, I thought the stock had a pretty good shot at 2025. While the stock has soared, the valuation has fallen because of strong earnings growth, thanks in large part to the seemingly never-ending demand for GPUs in exascale computing platforms. 2025 was destined to be the “Year of Blackwell,” and I expected the stock to continue to rise, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.

Instead, we saw the stock briefly try to break out to a new all-time high, or ATH, before reversing sharply and selling off. We know the various reasons for this reversal. On the one hand, the broader market sold off amid tariff uncertainty, and few companies were immune. the release of DeepSeek (DEEPSEEK) in early 2025 triggered a sort of flash panic, with some claiming that the boom time for high-end chips was over. The logic was that DeepSeek would be able to save costs and increase efficiency so dramatically that companies running AI reasoning could rely on much less powerful chips. I think the evidence so far is that this reasoning is completely wrong, and instead we're seeing the Jevons Paradox come true.

It was probably inevitable that NVIDIA would now lose essentially all of its China-related revenue. At a recent conference, CFO Colette Kress pretty much poured cold water on the company's prospects for generating further revenue in China.

In my opinion, NVIDIA is attractively valued. The two best performers this year among the Big 7 tech giants have been Microsoft and Meta. looking at how NVIDIA compares to these peers, I see a big gap between them at the moment. In terms of price-to-earnings ratio, NVIDIA's valuation sits right in the middle of the three, but in terms of return on invested capital and medium-term EPS projections, it's way ahead.",0,13,2025-06-15 17:41:16
MSFT,stocks,Barclays: History suggests S&P 500 could mark turning point,"With the S&P 500 now trading at 22 times next-twelve-month earnings, Barclays analysts say “valuation alone may not be one” of the major headwinds facing equities.

“SPX is back to 22x NTM EPS,” Barclays wrote, noting that “30 years of history suggest that current levels could signal bear capitulation assuming EPS growth stays positive.”

Barclays examined three decades of forward returns across valuation bands and found that “while average returns decreased (and the variance of those returns increased) as valuations rose from 10x to about 21x, returns actually improved modestly (and variance decreased) as NTM P/E crossed over 22x, up to about 24x.”

The analysts argued that this range “has typically traded at these levels for sustained periods in the aftermath of fast sell-offs and subsequent V-shaped recoveries (1998 and 2020 being prime examples),” adding that “22x could be a good approximation of where bears capitulate and ’animal spirits’ fuel the chase for additional upside.”

Stocks like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, BGM, PANW, and FTNT could benefit if valuations remain elevated and earnings growth picks up, as Barclays notes.

They cautioned, however, that “equities could be choppy over the near term as markets await clarity on US fiscal policy,” and that “2Q25 earnings \[are\] likely to feature the first substantive hit from tariffs.”

Still, Barclays emphasized that “we see a limited case for valuation alone as an argument against further upside,” especially if “earnings growth picks up to \~9% in 2026, as we expect,” they wrote.

Barclays concluded that while “several pitfalls from fiscal to tariffs lay ahead for equities,” the market’s current valuation is not necessarily a ceiling.",196,62,2025-06-13 13:35:58

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

META,stocks,Investing in Escapism?,"Hello there,

I’m a 28 yo gen Z from Thailand, been investing since I was 22. Currently holding about $119k in stocks.

The recent trends I’ve noticed from my peers is the general hopelessness and they will prefer to indulge themselves now over saving for the future. I believe that dissatisfaction/being miserable makes you spend more money, and asian people are very dissatisfied with themselves.

So I’ve been thinking what if this will become a long term trend? My biggest positions are Alibaba, Tencent (700), and Meta. my Meta shares were bought at $133 so they were doing quite well. Tencent was bought this year up 25%

While many turn to gaming (and I’m addicted to one myself), gaming stocks seem like a poor investment, I’ve heard gaming companies being compared to biotech in terms of risk. I have a small position on Gravity (GRVY) but it has been performing quite disappointingly.

I believe value added service/social media will be better pick since you make money off of ads and user content. in this regards, I think Tencent holds an incredible economic moat and is relatively well protected from tariffs compared to its peers. I also own LY Corp (4689) which operates Yahoo and LINE both are quite popular in Japan, LINE is also big in Thailand as well.

But I want to ask for your insights, do you think which industries or companies in particular will perform well in this era of increasing isolation and escapism?

Thank you for reading!

GOOG,stocks,"Oracle shares pop 15% to record high on earnings beat, cloud optimism","Oracle shares soared 15% on Thursday and headed for a record close and their best day since 2021, after the database software vendor issued robust earnings and a strong forecast, fueled by growth in cloud.

Revenue climbed 11% year over year during the fiscal fourth quarter to $15.9 billion, topping the $15.59 billion average estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.70 exceeded the average analyst estimate of $1.64.

“All told, ORCL has entered an entirely new wave of enterprise popularity that it has not seen since the Internet era in the late 90s,” Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a note to clients. The firm was one of several to lift its price target on the stock, raising its prediction to $190 from $130.

Oracle has been making headway in the cloud infrastructure market to challenge Amazon, Google and Microsoft. It’s still small by comparison, with $3 billion in cloud revenue during the May quarter, compared with over $12 billion for Google, which counts productivity software subscriptions and cloud infrastructure sales when reporting cloud metrics. But Oracle’s business is growing faster.

Future expansion can also come from sales of Oracle’s database on clouds other than its own.

“The growth rate in multi-cloud is astonishing,” Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said on Wednesday’s conference call with analysts. “In other words, our database is now moving very rapidly to the cloud, I think because – a few reasons, because the database has now all these AI capabilities, but also, quite frankly, now people can get it in whatever cloud they want.”

Remaining performance obligations, a measurement of money that’s expected to be recognized as revenue in the future, sat at $138 billion, up 41% from a year earlier. Oracle CEO Safra Catz said RPO will likely more than double in the 2026 fiscal year, which ends in May 2026. Revenue for the new fiscal year should come in above $67 billion, she said. That’s higher than LSEG’s $65.18 billion consensus.

Gains from OpenAI’s Stargate artificial intelligence data center project, targeting $500 billion in investments over four years, are not yet included in forecasts.

“If Stargate turns out to be, everything is advertised, then we’ve understated our RPO growth,” Ellison said.

For fiscal 2029, revenue should be above the $104 billion target the company set in September, Catz said.

Still, the company faces the challenge of meeting client demand in cloud.

“Demand continues to dramatically outstrip supply,” Catz said, though she added that the company isn’t having trouble sourcing Nvidia graphics processing units.

Analysts at RBC, who recommend holding the stock, raised their price target to $195 to $145. But they noted that, “with the backdrop of continued capacity constraints, we struggle to see a path to meaningful acceleration in the near term.”

Long story short - I realized ~$20k in losses back during the tariff meltdown.

I’m looking to shave some of my profits but don’t want to realize short term cap gains in the process. If I sell and realize $10k in gains, will I owe the respective short term cap gain, or will the loss that I realized compensate for the gain?

GOOG,stocks,Google offers buyouts to employees across the company. This trend has started in China and will extend to the western hemisphere,"Edit: Again, not saying that it actually started in China, but highlighting that everything is accelerating with AI systems which will define more optimal avenues for efficiency when it comes to workforce and for now some western hemisphere countries were relatively more protected given our labour laws and social safety nets. But with less employees, less savings for retirement or jobless earnings. Many topics /idea mixed below ( that’s the beauty of human brain/rambling vs edited by AI).

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/google-buyouts-search-ads-unit.html

This trend is likely to accelerate within the next 24 months in Usa. With major cuts expected in the NYSE AI listed companies, significant profits can be made. AI teams will be affected too. A tale of a snake eating its own tail and flesh.

But with the size of the China workforce in a country that produces more than one million engineers yearly, and with the expected rise of unemployment and accelerating AI mechanics , we might be at the dawn of a geopolitical shift in china and a redefinition of the power imbalance between low cost production countries and emerging low cost production countries in all continents.

Jobs average lifespan for employees getting lower and lower. From lifetime jobs more than 60 years ago to 1 month lifespan very soon.

For the hard or brick and mortar stuff, wouldn’t be surprised in the near future, if technologies companies which typically don’t pay dividends on consistent basis morph into  structures like REITs ( Real Estate Investment Trusts) and become REITs( Robots Ecosystems Industrial Trusts). You buy a stock of a company owning robots and the entity will pay you monthly dividends; but instead of a bond like return growing slowly, Dividends increase on yearly basis will be more substantial given AI efficiencies. The valuation of these IT companies will be more marketable using the dividend growth model.

TSLA,stocks,"Tesla: The First Robotaxi Video Shows a Dangerous, Illegal Turn","For context, a Reddit user posted this clip of the first Tesla Robotaxi in Austin: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1l855x7/first\_ever\_footage\_of\_tesla\_robotaxi\_testing\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1l855x7/first_ever_footage_of_tesla_robotaxi_testing_in/)

As you can see in the clip, the Tesla begins turning while there are pedestrians in the crosswalk, likely because it is camera-only and does not detect the pedestrians in that specific location.  Instead of waiting for the pedestrians, it instead stops in the middle of the intersection, while making a left turn on a non-protected green.  The vehicle comes to a rolling stop, in the middle of the road, with the passenger side completely exposed to oncoming traffic.  Despite pedestrians being in the crosswalk, the vehicle continues to slowly roll instead of coming to a complete stop, putting the vehicle in the worst possible position of being both in the way of traffic and moving towards pedestrians.  We can also see that the lead Tesla, the Robotaxi, applies the breaks aggressively, with little care or notice as to what or who is behind it.

If this clip was shown to a driving test instructor, and they were told it was a clip of a new driver, that driver would fail the test instantly.  This Tesla managed to put the pedestrians, on-coming traffic, and the vehicle behind it in danger at the same time.  All of this is likely due to Tesla's unique insistence that FSD can be achieved safely with vision only, as Tesla cuts costs by not including a full array of sensors similar to how Waymo works.

I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg.  Musk has ruined his reputation over the past year and the TSLA stock is being propped up by low-volume retail traders that are praying for a future Musk promises, yet never comes.  I feel Tesla has rushed out the Robotaxi program to distract from an incoming terrible quarterly report, and they've clearly done so at the expense of safety.  My best case scenario for Tesla is that the Robotaxi is safer than it seems and struggles to gain market from Waymo, and they fail to add anything significant to the bottom line.  My worst case scenario is that a Robotaxi fails to see a pedestrian and kills them, essentially killing any dream of Tesla Robotaxis in the 2020's.

Full disclosure: I am currently long on TSLQ, an ETF that attempts to match double the inverse of Tesla's daily performance.  For anyone unfamiliar with inverse ETFs, that means I am extremely bearish on Tesla, and have taken a position which will explode if Tesla fails.  My personal feeling is that the Robotaxi launch combined with a terrible quarterly report sometime in July will push TSLA down to the 200 range and TSLQ up 100% or more from current values.  I am not a professional or giving advice though, just my personal feelings.",555,205,2025-06-11 10:44:11

To be clear I’m not asking what specific EV consumer brands you like, though that’s an interesting question.

I’m thinking more broadly about enabling infrastructure, raw materials (e.g. lithium production), etc. If we assume that overall the world will increasingly rely on EVs as the years go on, what underlying primary or secondary markets do you envision becoming attractive? 

To start - I’m very interested in companies that mine and refine lithium, and exploring ways to get some exposure to lithium and earth metal refining in my portfolio. ",0,27,2025-06-12 17:51:25

NVDA,stocks,Taiwan Semiconductor’s May sales jump 39.6% as AI demand stays strong,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), the primary chip supplier to Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), reported a 39.6% year-over-year rise in May revenue as clients rushed to stockpile chips amid growing trade tensions.

The company generated NT$320.5 billion ($10.7 billion) in revenue last month. While this marks a strong annual increase, it's an 8.3% decline from April, when TSMC saw a sharper 48.1% year-over-year gain.

Revenue for January through May 2025 totaled NT$1,509.34 billion, an increase of 42.6% compared to the same period in 2024.

Looking ahead, analysts project a 50.3% Y/Y increase in TSMC's second-quarter sales, signaling continued robust demand despite month-over-month volatility.

TSMC chief executive and Chairman C.C. Wei said last week that the demand for the company's AI chips continues to outweigh supply.

The chipmaker reported strong Q1 results in April and issued a positive outlook for the coming years. ""We continue to observe robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2025. We reaffirm our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025,"" said Wei on the earnings call.",116,11,2025-06-10 23:15:17
TSLA,stocks,TSLA Shares Rebound as Musk Steps Back from Trump Clash,"So Elon Musk just backed off from his beef with Trump, saying on X that some of his posts went “too far” and he regrets them That’s a pretty big shift after all the drama. Trump, meanwhile, isn’t interested in making up and warned Musk he could face “serious consequences” if he helps Democrats

This whole feud has Wall Street on edge, especially Tesla investors. Tesla’s rollout of its robotaxi service in Austin is supposed to kick off June 22 but there’s worry Trump might use federal regulators to slow things down kind of a political roadblock that could hit Tesla’s growth hard

Tesla shares bounced back almost 2% early Wednesday, recovering some of last week’s losses when the Musk-Trump drama blew up

From an investor’s perspective  how do you see this playing out? Does Musk’s “sorry” move calm the waters enough to keep Tesla on track? Or is the political heat going to keep putting a ceiling on Tesla’s potential?",4,35,2025-06-11 18:36:02

[**TSLA (Tesla)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-More easing in Trump/Musk tensions, both have tweeted reconciliatory tweets earlier this morning and it seems their feud is at an end. Trump announced a 'done deal' in the rare earths deal, causing a small spike to the market premarket. The buying opportunity was the day of the tweets but obviously, still interesting to see if the Trump/Musk relationship can be completely repaired. It seems both sides are playing damage control and trying to repair the rift. There's been huge discontent from Musk due to Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" but we've moved from 325->275 ->335. MASSIVE move and trade of the month.

[**OUST (Ouster)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=OUST&p=d)\-Premarket announcement that the US Department of Defense approved its OS1 digital lidar sensor for use in unmanned aerial systems. Most of the move occurred premarket, but will be watching to see if we make another leg higher- the daily chart looks near parabolic if we move up again today/tomorrow with a move from 7.50 to 20 in the past month.

[**CRWV (Coreweave)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\- Staying surprisingly resilient at \~$160, we've also seen upward momentum an hour before the open (154->160). Overall nothing too compelling for a short unless we rocket past 160 to something ludicrous, this has stayed up longer/stronger than CRCL so far more interested in this.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\-Somewhat still hovering fairly high from Jeff Bezos posting a picture that implied a partnership. This has diverged from RKLB's move up, and is still hovering around $36. Nothing too compelling unless we make a leg higher.

META,stocks,"Zuckerberg, Frustrated by Meta’s “Slow” AI Progress, Personally Hiring New “Superintelligence” AI Team","

Mark Zuckerberg, frustrated with Meta Platforms Inc.’s shortfalls in AI, is assembling a team of experts to achieve artificial general intelligence, recruiting from a brain trust of AI researchers and engineers who’ve met with him in recent weeks at his homes in Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto.

Zuckerberg has prioritized recruiting for the secretive new team, referred to internally as a superintelligence group, according to people familiar with his plans. He has an audacious goal in mind, these people said. In his view, Meta can and should outstrip other tech companies in achieving what’s known as artificial general intelligence or AGI, the notion that machines can perform as well as humans at many tasks. Once Meta reaches that milestone, it could weave the capability into its suite of products — not just social media and communications platforms, but also a range of AI tools, including the Meta chatbot and its AI-powered Ray-Ban glasses.

Zuckerberg aims to hire around 50 people for the new team, including a new head of AI research, almost all of whom he’s recruiting personally. He’s rearranged desks at the company’s Menlo Park headquarters so the new staff will sit near him, the people said, asking to remain anonymous discussing private plans. 

Zuckerberg is building that team in tandem with a planned multi-billion dollar investment in Scale AI, which offers data services to help companies train their models. Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang is expected to join the superintelligence group after a deal is done. Bloomberg News first reported on the deal, set to become Meta’s largest external investment to date. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Zuckerberg has spoken openly about making artificial intelligence a priority for his company. In the last two months, he’s gone into “founder mode,” according to people familiar with his work, who described an increasingly hands-on management style.

GOOG,stocks,Could OpenAI use Google Cloud? What does this mean for GOOG stocks?,"Hey guys just read the news about goog that OpenAI is in talks with Google Cloud to possibly migrate some of its AI training loads from Microsoft Azure If true, what will this do to the stock of Google's parent company Alphabet (GOOG)?

Let's start with the reasons why OpenAI might be moving to Google Cloud:

I think it might be to avoid vendor lock-in: OpenAI doesn't want to be tied to Microsoft Azure alone, especially if Microsoft's supply of arithmetic power can't keep up with demand  

Competitive pricing: Google Cloud may offer more competitive pricing on TPU/GPU resources, especially since training large models is extremely costly

Technology differentiation: Google's TPU v5e and Vertex AI may be more efficient than Azure for certain AI tasks

What would be the benefits to Google if they did move to Google Cloud?

Cloud business growth: if OpenAI does migrate some of its loads, Google Cloud revenues will directly benefit AI-related demand could accelerate

AI ecosystem strengthening: we all know that Google has already invested in Anthropic (ChatGPT competitor) adding OpenAI would further strengthen its AI infrastructure position

 Sentiment Boost: Investors have been worried that Google is falling behind Microsoft in the AI race, and this deal could ease that anxiety and boost the stock price.

The favorable impacts of the above are indeed many but there are still many potential factors:

We need to understand that Microsoft is still the biggest owner of OpenAI: it has invested tens of billions of dollars, and it has first right of refusal to commercialize OpenAI technology.69 Even if it uses the Google Cloud, Microsoft will still be able to take a cut of OpenAI's revenue.

Regulatory risk: If OpenAI and Google get too close, the antitrust agency could get involved.

How will the market react?

Short term: If the news is confirmed, GOOG may jump 3-5%.

Long-term: It's critical to see if Google can use OpenAI to close the AI gap with Azure Currently, Microsoft is earning a lot of eyeballs by integrating Bing/Office with ChatGPT Google is in dire need of the same level of AI use cases

Guys what do you think, will GOOG take off as a result or will Microsoft remain on the AI throne?",168,81,2025-06-10 16:36:14

[**CRWV**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWV&p=d)\-DA Davidson released commentary suggesting their pro forma had underestimated its debt situation while not properly accounting for borrowing costs. This stock is ridiculously run up since IPO (\~4x it's opening price). Daily setup doesn’t look like a clean short, but watching to see if it mimics CRCL’s recent surge at the open yesterday. Interested in seeing if it breaks the highs ($166). Obviously CRWV has a huge debt load due to their GPUs/training chips, but whether this will actually affect the stock price remains to be seen.

[**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)\-Musk/Trump tensions have cooled down and Trump publicly stated that they will keep their White House Starlink. This happened about 30 mins before the close and caused TSLA to shoot up a little, and ASTS/RKLB to sell off. TSLA was extremely interesting the day of the feud, but currently I'm minorly long.

[**ASTS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)**/**[**RKLB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKLB&p=d)\-Part of the broader spaceflight stock rally that began earlier this week, mainly due to Jeff Bezos implying a partnership through a picture with ASTS. Has been on a tear for the past 3 days, might have topped out yesterday. Wasn't this watching this too closely because I was trading CRCL but still interested to see if this makes a higher leg up. Yesterday was the most interesting day for this and RKLB, but if this breaks highs again today then I'll be interested.

[**CRCL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\-Strong run post-IPO has made this the most interesting stock this week outside of TSLA. Very likely we topped out yesterday but watching for additional momentum. Keep in mind that this is mainly ""C"" money + the hype of a recent C stock and IPO success of CRWV that has propelled this higher (it is a solid business model as well)\_. I think the momentum in this has deflated (we surged briefly off the open and then sold off for most of the day).

[**AAPL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-Intraday selloff yesterday came as excitement over the “Liquid Glass Design” underwhelmed, revealing more of a UI update than hardware innovation. WWDC tends to be a ""sell-the-news"" event.

META,stocks,Meta Set to Throw Billions at Startup That Leads AI Data Market,"Meta is considering investing as much as $10B in AI data company Scale AI, a company they've helped finance in that past to a current tune of $14B.

Created by two founders in their late 20s, Alex Wang and Lisa Guo, Scale AI has sold digging materials to gold miners, using an ""army of contractors"" to label the data that tech firms such as Meta and OpenAI depend on to train and improve their AI models.

Should the financing come to fruition it would become one of the largest private fundings of all time. Although forced out in 2018,  Lisa Guo's stake, due to the company's current valuation, makes her the world's current youngest female billionaire.

What does the sub think of this? Is this Meta making moves to get out ahead in the AI arms race? Or is this another seemingly desperate pivot from a social media giant concerned about future irrelevance?

GOOG,investing,Amazon's $84M stake on AMD. A sleeper AI bet?,"Amazon bought 822,234 shares of AMD, worth about $84.5 million as of March 31. It’s the first time Amazon has ever disclosed a stake in the semiconductor company. It also happened to be the only new position in their entire portfolio last quarter.

At the time of the filing, AMD’s stock was down \~6% YTD while the broader chip sector was almost flat. Then, just one week after the 13F dropped, AMD announced a $6B stock buyback boosting its total repurchase capacity to $10B. This came right after unveiling a $10B AI partnership with Saudi-backed startup Humain, which is building Arabic LLMs and data center infrastructure across the Middle East.

Amazon’s cloud division, AWS, already uses AMD’s EPYC chips in some of its instances. With Nvidia supply tight and AMD pushing its MI300X AI accelerators, the move might hint at deeper strategic alignment. It’s also possible Amazon wanted to lock in a chip partner for its growing AI infrastructure push especially as it faces off with Microsoft and Google.

AMD was trading nearly 40% off its 52-week high when Amazon bought in.

MSFT,investing,S&P 500 premium is mostly warranted says BofA,"Bank of America analysts argued in a note Friday that the S&P 500’s valuation premium is “mostly warranted,” despite the index appearing expensive by traditional measures.

“The S&P 500 now trades at 21x forward earnings, 35% above average,” BofA wrote, adding that it “looks statistically expensive relative to its own history on all 20 of the valuation metrics we track.”

However, the analysts say comparisons to historical averages may be misleading.

“Today’s S&P is apples vs. prior decades’ oranges,” they said, noting a shift in sector composition.

“Nearly 70% of the index was asset-intensive Manufacturing sectors in 1980 vs. <20% today.”

They argue the index “has become higher quality, with lower leverage, lower earnings volatility, and higher margins.”

BofA also defended the U.S. market’s premium over global peers. “The US trades as the most expensive region (\~40% premium vs. Europe/Asia which trade at 16x),” they noted, but emphasized that “quality, balance sheets, growth potential and risk are statistically superior.”

They pointed to the U.S. being “half as levered as other regions” and praised “significantly lower estimate dispersion on 2025/2026 forecasts.”

Additionally, the U.S. offers “roughly double the long-term growth potential of Asia and Europe, with lower earnings volatility than Europe, plus higher free cash flow per share and a lower percentage of non-earners vs. both Asia and Europe,” says the bank.

BofA also cited structural advantages including “labor fungibility, USD as reserve currency, energy independence, unparalleled liquidity and Tech primacy (at least for now).”

GOOGL, MSFT, NEE, META, BGM, and FCX may benefit from the S&P 500’s sector shift toward higher-quality, capital-light companies, especially in tech, renewables, and metals.

For near-term positioning, BofA’s tactical model prefers U.S. “Communication Services, Utilities and Tech,” and highlights “Interactive Media & Services, Metals & Mining and Independent Power & Renewable Electricity Producers” as top industry opportunities.",148,88,2025-06-13 13:25:40

NVDA,investing,Which brokerage offers the best Roth IRA account for active traders,"Which platform is better for those looking to actively trade in a roth account?

\-stocks, options, etc

\-margin, at least 2x, and will let it ride overnight like regular margin accounts

\-ideally access to funds

\-good reporting and ui. 

\-fractional share buying. 

  
The thing I love about Fidelity is that you can buy shares with as little as a $1. But with Interactive Brokers Pro, you are paying a steep fee for that. I don't think ToS/CS has this feature. I also love how Fidelity shows you the buy price of each purchase, as well as their Profit/Loss. Trying to trade options on Fidelity has to be the worst experience I've ever had. Absolute garbage. Thinkorswim is smooth, but IBKR Pro offers so much power and options. 

  
I want to open weekly covered call positions on Snap/CMG/WRBY using 2x margin. This is what I will mostly be doing. I typically beat the market when I only trade stocks. I significantly underperform when I trade options or futures, mostly due to greed.

I want to trade index options like NDX/SPX, as well as other stuff like qqq, nvda, cmg, etc

I don't do much futures trading but I do want to be able to buy futures, and futures options.

And I want to be able to buy overnight, if not 24 hours. Tos/CS does not offer this which sucks.

UPS:- Global leader in logistics and parcel delivery and  a solid dividend yield (~4–5% as of 2025). As an online retailer I use UPS over any other shipping company for my business. Why? Fair pricing and great customer service.

TGT:- A Dividend King: Has raised dividends for over 50 consecutive years and also strong partnerships (e.g., with Disney, Ulta Beauty) help attract traffic and broaden offerings.

Enphase:- Enphase is the global leader in micro-inverters. Long-term demand for solar + battery storage is expected to grow rapidly.

UNH:- You all know about this. It’s a top-tier defensive growth stock.

Uber:- It’s a high-growth, tech-forward transportation and logistics bet. Unlike the more mature, stable companies like UNH or UPS, Uber is still in a scaling and profitability expansion phase, but with some strong strategic advantages.

INTC:- This can be very good turn around play. it still holds strategic value and still dominates in PC and server CPU markets, especially among enterprise buyers. Where I work they all use Intel and no way they going to change to other companies anytime soon. 

DVN:- A good dividend play. In strong oil markets, this leads to yields as high as 8–10%, sometimes even higher. Great fundamentals and way undervalued as of today.

Solar stocks such as Sunrun (RUN), SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and First Solar (FSLR) plunged overnight after the newly released Senate budget bill would keep a full phase-out of solar and wind energy tax credits by 2028.

The GOP-led Senate Finance Committee late Monday unveiled changes to the Trump budget bill that passed the House, but left the wind-down of solar and wind incentives.

Sunrun stock dived 35.4% early Tuesday, with SolarEdge down 30.3%, Enphase Energy (ENPH) 19.9% and First Solar stock 16.3%. Array Technologies (ARRY) gave up 13.7%, Shoals Technologies (SHLS) 10.1% and Nextracker (NXT) 13.8%. Nextera Energy (NEE) lost 2.8%.

A decline in solar and wind projects could affect demand for battery storage. But Fluence Energy (FLNC) rose 3.%.

Tesla (TSLA) has a notable storage business under Tesla Energy while the Senate bill would end the $7,500 tax credit for EVs 180 days after becoming law. That's vs. the House's end-of-2025 cut-off. Tesla stock dipped 0.6% in premarket action.",36,8,2025-06-17 17:25:25
META,StockMarket,US and UK say they’ve cemented a trade agreement that Trump calls fair for both nations,"No paywall: [https://apnews.com/article/trump-starmer-trade-deal-beef-g7-52bea5eb383a0b45d0d83e1982d277bf](https://apnews.com/article/trump-starmer-trade-deal-beef-g7-52bea5eb383a0b45d0d83e1982d277bf)

President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that they are signing a trade deal that will slash tariffs on goods from both countries.

The deal does not include tariffs on steel, an especially important piece of bilateral trade. Instead, talks are still going on about whether steel tariffs will be cut to zero as planned in the provisional agreement.

Trump and Starmer announced in May they’d struck an agreement that would slash U.S. import taxes on British cars, steel and aluminum in return for greater access to the British market for U.S. products including beef and ethanol.

But it did not immediately take effect, leaving British businesses uncertain about whether the U.K. could be exposed to any surprise hikes from Trump.

British businesses, and the U.K. government, were blindsided earlier this month when Trump doubled metals tariffs on countries around the world to 50%. He later clarified the level would remain at 25% for the U.K.

Starmer said Monday that the trade agreement is “in the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.”

Trump said the deal is “gonna produce a lot of jobs, a lot of income.”",324,91,2025-06-16 23:45:20

There's a lot on the domestic calendar this week. But investors and the world are watching global affairs, too.

Meanwhile, several market-driving events are due in the coming days. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, consumer spending data, and possible news on President Donald Trump's tariffs headline the week. Thursday's Juneteenth holiday will mean a break from trading.

The Fed will hand down another decision on interest rates this week, with a decision scheduled for Wednesday. The coming weekend could see Tesla providing a significant update on the direction of the electric vehicle maker.

Did consumers in May continue to prop up the economy? Tuesday's U.S. retail sales will make it clear whether strong spending levels continued, while housing construction data will provide insight into whether builders are catching up with lagging inventory levels. Investors will continue to watch for trade developments as negotiations continue between U.S. officials and key trading partners.

It’s a light week for corporate earnings, highlighted by expected reports from homebuilder Lennar, accounting firm Accenture, grocery chain Kroger, and online used car seller CarMax.

# Fed Interest-Rate Decision Comes Amid Increasing Pressure for Cuts

Fed officials have said they are keeping rates steady amid a strong labor market as they monitor inflation data for signs that Trump’s tariffs are driving up prices.

But the pressure is on the Federal Reserve after May inflation data came in lower than economists expected. Despite comments from President Donald Trump urging the Fed to make a one-point cut, investors don't expect the central bank to take action when its two-day meeting concludes on Wednesday.

The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures fed funds futures to determine the path of interest rates, indicates that traders overwhelmingly believe that Fed will keep rates at their current levels in June. They also don't expect the central bank to move rates at its late July meeting.

After the meeting concludes on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will provide more insight into the central bank’s view on the economy and interest rates when he takes media questions.

On Tuesday, retail sales figures from May will provide another barometer of the economy's health Consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, housing data will also be scrutinized as affordability issues continue to depress home sales. The latest homebuilder confidence reading on Tuesday will show if construction industry officials see improvements coming in the market, while Wednesday’s housing starts data will indicate whether construction levels are rising amid a need for more housing inventory.

# Tesla Robotaxi Rollout Could Come as Early as Sunday

After months of waiting, investors could soon get a key update from electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA). CEO Elon Musk said in a recent social media post that the company could roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as early as Sunday, June 22. ""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk wrote.

The introduction of the company's robotaxi service could be a key moment for Tesla, which is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) and self-driving vehicles to become the transportation technologies of the future. Tesla is well-positioned to lead the market in the emerging technology, analysts have concluded, with Goldman Sachs writing that the EV maker could have a leg up on the competition through its ability to train self-driving through its AI development and to quickly scale production levels of the technology.

Despite a light corporate earnings schedule this week, investors will still get some expected updates from noteworthy companies.

Lennar’s (LEN) expected report after the bell on Monday follows the homebuilder's warning of weakness in the housing market in the prior quarter.  The scheduled Friday reports from accounting firm Accenture (ACN) and online car seller CarMax (KMX) will be posted in the shadow of both companies' lower-than-expected profits in the prior quarter.

GOOG,StockMarket,"[ORCL] Larry Ellison's customer: ""We will take all the capacity you have wherever it is""","\[Edit: reposted images in higher resolution\]

I view Oracle’s (ORCL) post earnings market rally as an extension of the company’s premium valuation. The FY’25 report assured investors that the company is delivering, which is likely contributing to an extrapolation of success estimates for the company.

Summarizing my valuation below, I estimate an intrinsic value for Oracle of around $324 or $113 per share with projected revenues of $180B by the end of my 10-year forecast period. I also expect the company to maintain momentum and increase its operating margin to 35% by 2030 via cross-selling to new customers and upgrading its infrastructure to an autonomous cloud. In my view, the current rally is pricing the fundamentals above a 5-year premium which is too much of a risk.

https://preview.redd.it/06gv1ayj3v6f1.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=04901d7c65221ad6bdb50b98fb9f282285c21fcb

At these price-levels I suspect that many investors \[including myself\] may have missed the boat on Oracle, and that is ok.

# Oracle Is Entering A Growth Upcycle

In Oracle’s FY 25 earnings call, they outlined their move to ramp up cloud infrastructure capacity in order to meet an unprecedented $138B worth of remaining performance obligations – A number which is expected to continue growing.

Oracle’s chairman, Mr. Ellison noted that they recently got an order that said

*“We will take all the capacity you have wherever it is.”*

While the statement is true, keep in-mind that it’s also a well-crafted pitch to investors.

The company posted a record $57.4B FY ‘25 revenue, up 8% from the $52.96B in 2024, with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \[OCI\] contributing 74%. The company expects to break out of its single digit growth rate, and has guided for a >16% revenue growth in 2026.

https://preview.redd.it/h8tnim8yzu6f1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5be3280a2c2bea4a2b337bfd9d6c2e25fe0894

There is currently a supply constraint for cloud infrastructure across the industry, and as long as AI applications are producing meaningful demand I expect the revenue growth for Oracle to persist. In my model, I will pull the revenue growth line forward for the next 4 years, but I do expect normalization after that and revert to single digit growth.

As you can see from the image below, the problem I have with Oracle is that revenues did not meaningfully improve prior to 2022 i.e. when AI entered the scene.

https://preview.redd.it/v8alsu553v6f1.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a6fa899bdd9d32d43eb57aa51ec7b4c38607f86

In my view, the pre-2022 stagnation was a reflection of a brand-name impact from the past that kept customers away from Oracle’s products. Further, AWS and other cloud vendors provided viable alternatives, drawing market share. However, Oracle now has a chance to reinvent itself as more customers are steered into their cloud due to the lack of supply among cloud peers.

# Going All In On The Cloud

The company has invested $21.2B in capex, primarily consisting of infrastructure for the cloud business. For 2026, Oracle is intending to ramp up capex to over $25B.

The company is making a large bet on the cloud, and is even increasing leverage by around $5.6B to fund the projects. They will likely further increase debt levels in order to build their data centers, but I see this as an opportunity to positively recapitalize the company and maximize returns. For reference, Oracle currently has some $115B in debt, representing a Debt to Equity \[market value\] ratio of 18.6%. In my view, the company has room to increase this ratio and taking on more debt to fund a high-demand business is the right move.

# Oracle’s Pitch To AI Demand: The Vector Database

The fundamental product for Oracle is the database. Everything that oracle does, ties in some way to their database products with the core being relational (table) databases such as MySQL. Over time, the company has launched products that complement their database products by offering a place to host their database - such as the cloud, and creating software products from the database such as their ERP/CRM products.

Note that alongside the database, Oracle provides all the standard cloud products such as compute, storage, and their derivatives.

Now with the rise of AI demand, Oracle is optimizing the database for use of AI applications. This comes in the form of a vector database (highly recommended Fireship's YT video on vector databases) that is able to store data by similarity via embeddings, allowing AI applications to draw additional context from the database when the user makes a query.

https://preview.redd.it/uhv4ndf10v6f1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=85dae7283c5e4d350e6be0c42f835ff3709d6126

Oracle is pitching the vector database as a way for customers to increase the efficacy of their AI model, as well as a completely private product that can be accessed in the cloud. This enables customers to use their own proprietary data for context so that the AI model can produce tailored results. Oracle is not the only vector product on the market, and the space has seen a surge of innovation, but the company does offer database privacy features that are key to customers with proprietary data.

In my view, it will be a tight race between all cloud providers as they innovate in rapid succession. While Oracle holds the rights for MySQL and lends them under license agreements, competitors offer the open-source alternatives such as Postgresql - a highly scaleable relational database \[with many plugins, including for vector data\]. These alternatives are offered and supported in all large cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, etc. This is why I don’t expect Oracle to maintain any persistent technological edge, and that their primary revenue driver will be the supply shortage for cloud infrastructure.

About a year ago, I was in a cloud presentation event. After the keynotes, we were chatting around with people. Most of the programmers shared their experience with either AWS or Google, and there was only 1 person that pitched Oracle cloud. He was a bit more on the eccentric side, but made a compelling argument about the price to performance for OCI. In the future, I expect OCI to go much more mainstream among the development community, developers to start experimenting, and later pitching their managers for OCI.

However, at the end of the day Oracle’s largest revenue contributors will continue being enterprise-level companies, so a bet on Oracle is a bet that these companies are going to need cloud & database products and a direct line of support.

# Valuation

Using the assumptions and updated numbers, I have constructed an unlevered DCF model for Oracle:

* Revenue growth 20%, 25%, and 20% in the next three years respectively. Converging on the riskfree rate after that. This results in revenues of $180B at the end of my forecast period, up some 3x from 2025.
* An increase in profitability after the infrastructure ramp due to moving an increasing portion of infrastructure from gen. 2 cloud to an autonomous cloud.
* Total reinvestment \[net of depreciation\] around $20B in the next 2 years.
* Negative free cash flows during the ramp period, up to 46B in year 10.
* Low, 8.5% cost of capital from the outset reflecting the stability of the organization.

https://preview.redd.it/s3bzxvh93v6f1.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd8aa0fb5d4daa040fc0a39ed444216b8b7804b

The sum of present value comes up to $421, netting out debt and cash, I get an intrinsic value of $324 or $113 per share for the company.

While the debt is a great financing vehicle for CapEx investment, it still weighs on the final valuation and is reducing the intrinsic value by some $100B.

# Pricing At Maturity

Using the forecasts from my model, I estimate that Oracle will be able to produce around $46B in free cash flows by the end of my 10-year forecast period. At a 2035 20x FCF multiple, the forward pricing comes up to $920B. Discounting at a 8.5% rate back 10 years, I get a pricing of $407B or **$142** per share.

`[920 / 1.085^10 = 407]`

By comparing both approaches we see that despite being overvalued at the current price levels, the value of the equity may rise by an 8.5% CAGR for 10 years to reach a $920B valuation. I did not assign any excess returns to the company as I expect increased competition in the cloud infrastructure space, database innovation, and the ERP software.

My $920B pricing is indicative of just how far investors can take Oracle’s valuation with the *generous* assumption that they can wait out the price to value gap. In my view, if Oracle breaks above this point, its fundamentals will be fully priced-in for the next 10 years.

# Conclusion

As of the time of writing, Oracle has a market cap of $618B, indicating that the market is ahead of my $324B valuation by around 7 years, and 5 years ahead of my $407B pricing. This indicates that investors need to hold the company for 5-7 years before the fundamentals break-even on the current price.

In my view, 3 years is an acceptable premium for quality companies, and barring any major flaws in my predictions, I view the risk to return asymmetry to be unfavorable at the current price.

Using my intrinsic value, the 3-year premium range for the company would come up to $144 per share, which is where I would consider Oracle to be a portfolio candidate.

`[113 * 1.085^3 = 148]`

The company is on a growth uptrend, and I expect it to continue for at least the next 2 years. AI may not be the only growth driver, and Oracle may sustain higher growth rates from its ERP software applications, as well as the opening up of dormant cloud demand for industries such as the military industry with the digitization of drones. Because of this, it is likely that the company will continue trading 3 to 5 years ahead of the fundamentals.

Investors that had a position in the company pre-earnings may consider taking profit after the company shows a slowdown in its acceleration, which may take at least a few quarters. Finally, going short on the stock may not be wise despite the price being ahead of the fundamentals.

# Risks

* The cloud infrastructure demand cycle may be shorter than expected, and many customers may abandon their AI projects or switch to ready-made solutions by some of the large vendors. Innovation avenues in this space may become more narrow and the demand for training compute will alleviate the supply shortage.
* Large AI vendors may produce breakthroughs in the amount of compute required for AI inference and training, significantly changing the demand curve. Google, Microsoft and most other large vendors are already releasing light versions of their models \[phi, gemma\].
* Oracle had a 10-year period with little meaningful growth pre-2022 which was partly driven by the innovation of database technologies from cloud competitors. If the company fails to maintain a unique aspect to their value proposition \[such as the mentioned private cloud\], it will find it difficult to keep up growth after the next few years.
* Customers may switch their database preferences from a centralized and highly scalable database like MySQL to smaller and localized versions such as SQLite. MySQL is a good fit for large companies, but there is a case to be made that SMBs do not require the scale of a database of Oracle’s caliber. The development community has been increasingly experimenting with smaller and open-source alternatives, which may lead to more pitches from developers to managers to switch to lighter alternatives.
* Oracle’s software and infrastructure is sometimes reported to be difficult to work with. This has been a drag on the company’s brand reputation for software and databases alike.
* AI is great at producing insights from technical documentation, which enables easier implementations & troubleshooting of alternative databases, eroding Oracle’s support services moat.
* Oracle will keep maintaining pricing power relative to the quality of their competitors – if at any point competitive databases become higher quality or less risky to adopt, we will likely see an increase in the quality of Oracle products.",15,17,2025-06-14 11:11:55

GOOG,StockMarket,"IBM (NYSE: IBM) announces new quantum processor, plan for Starling supercomputer by 2029","* IBM on Tuesday announced a detailed roadmap to develop a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer called Quantum Starling.
* Part of the company’s plan involves the new IBM Quantum Nighthawk processor, which is set to release later this year, according to a blog post announcing the roadmap.
* Microsoft and Amazon announced quantum chips this year, following Google’s “Willow” rollout in December.

""“Unlocking the full promise of quantum computing will require a device capable of running larger, deeper circuits with hundreds of millions of gates operating on hundreds of qubits, at least,” the company said in a blog post. “More than that, it will require a device capable of correcting errors and preventing them from spreading throughout the system. ... it will require a fault-tolerant quantum computer.""",17,1,2025-06-10 20:15:20
NVDA,StockMarket,Is the AI Frenzy Far from Over? Which Concept Stocks Are Reaching New Highs?,"There has been a chart circulating online comparing the stock trends of Cisco vs. Nvidia. The sharp decline in $NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$'s stock price at the beginning of the year brings back memories of Cisco in the 1990s. After the burst of the dot-com bubble, companies like $Cisco (CSCO.US)$ and $Intel (INTC.US)$ saw their stock prices plummet. Investors want to know if Nvidia will face the same fate.

However, there has been a new twist in this chart. On April 30th, a pivot occurred with Microsoft's earnings; Nvidia also continued its upward trend when it announced a series of contracts from the Middle East.

The quarterly earnings released by Microsoft sends a clear message: the AI juggernaut rolls on, at least for now. Since the earnings release, Microsoft's stock price has soared over 17%. This news has been comforting to the entire AI sector, proving that companies are not disappointed in this highly hyped technology. Microsoft's strong performance has also led the market to infer an increased demand for Nvidia chips.

Additionally, with Trump and bin Salman endorsing the US-Saudi AI deal, Nvidia said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips in Saudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest ""Blackwell"" chips going to Humain, an AI startup just launched by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. Nvidia's stock price has recovered from its sharp decline at the beginning of the year.

**Is the AI frenzy far from over?**

Recent trends in AI concept stocks indicate that the AI ""stock market fuel"" is far from running out. On Monday, $Applied Digital (APLD.US)$ announced a transformative $7 billion, 15-year AI data center lease agreement with $CoreWeave (CRWV.US)$, a leading AI hyperscaler. Applied Digital saw its stock price skyrocket by 48.46%, closing at $10.14. Meanwhile, CoreWeave's stock has more than doubled since the start of the year.

$Tempus AI (TEM.US)$, a ""precision medicine"" company that leverages artificial intelligence to better treat patients, Shares soared 15% on Monday. Late Friday, the company announced an initiative it calls Fuses, a program designed to transform therapeutic research and build the largest diagnostic platform using its novel foundation model. Since the beginning of the year, Tempus AI's stock has surged by 88%, while the telehealth firms $Hims & Hers Health (HIMS.US)$ has skyrocketed nearly 135%.

**$Palantir (PLTR.US)$'s stock price has also continued to reach new highs, rising 74% since the beginning of the year. The up-and-coming AI firm $BGM is up over 88% so far this year.**

Furthermore, $Broadcom (AVGO.US)$ will release its second-quarter financial report after the market closes on June 5th. Wall Street expects the chipmaker to report growing revenue and profits fueled by demand for AI chips. Broadcom may soon become the first big tech stock to break historical highs. Its current stock price is $248.71, just under 1% lower than the peak of $250.45 in December last year.",0,8,2025-06-11 15:56:33

Take a look at this chart.

Orange line = SPX  
Blue line = SPX without AAPL, MSFT, META, NFLX, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, COST

Now tell me honestly… is this really a bull market?

Or is it mostly tech bull market where tech names like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix and Google and Amazon too... 

Because if you remove these 7 tech names plus Costco too, the rest of the market looks like it’s been going sideways or even rolling over hard. This ain't a healthy, broad-based rally. It’s basically just a handful of mega caps doing all the heavy lifting while the rest of the market is lagging behind big time. 

There are other few more stocks that have done well such PLTR and WMT and HOOD and UBER that are much at their ATH... Feels like everyone’s celebrating all-time highs, but under the surface it's a different story.

Most stocks aren’t even close to their highs. **Such as AMD, Paypal, Target, NKE, ADBE, ABNB a**nd many many more. Those big names are down big times from **50% or even 70%** more down from their **ATH**  
Even chinese stocks such as BABA and Bidu are down and trading at very low valuations...

Personally i would like to ask how can any average person who is coming hot in this market which might seem easy on surface but very to invest in because on one hand you are either investing in tech stocks that are highest gainers but at absurd valuations or betting on losers that haven't gained any momentum in this market even though stock market is at pretty pretty close to ATH. 

So again… is this really a bull market?",401,295,2025-06-09 14:56:21

META,StockMarket,Scale+Meta/OpenAi+Apple... impact on Palantir?,"Palantir has been positioning itself as the answer to all Enterprise's problems, but how could these partnerships affect that? 

I have been building a few apps recently, and I'm moving away from API calls to training an agentic ai. It's pretty easy for a person like me, with low level coding skills to achieve this. I can upload any number of files which will instruct it on how to begave, set guardrails etc. I imagine for a team of seasoned programmers it will be a lot easier and way more effective. These calls are cheap as hell too.

Seems to me that much of the 500+ P/E ratio for PLTR is based on their forward enterprise TAM. And if it becomes easier and much cheaper for companies to develop their own systems, TAM is surely affected.

AMZN,StockMarket,AMZN + ASTS = Global Sovereign Connectivity and Cloud Services,"I've been thinking about some recent news, and I need to share this theory because it feels big for AST SpaceMobile ($ASTS). This is just me connecting some dots, but it looks like something major could be brewing between them and Amazon.

First, just this past Monday, Jeff Bezos met with Abel Avellan, the CEO of ASTS and Adriana Cisneros, the first major ASTS investor. Adriana later posted saying ""amazing things are happening at ASTS and Blue Origin, congrats Abel and Jeff!"" That alone is a pretty big deal – Bezos doesn't usually make those kinds of public appearances for nothing.

**Then, literally the next day, Amazon drops news about launching a completely new, ""Sovereign Cloud"" business in Europe.** What that means is it's a super secure cloud, totally separate, managed entirely by EU citizens within the EU, designed for governments and super sensitive data. It’s built for total control and independence for European clients. **Now, about a month ago, ASTS and Vodafone announced their own joint venture in Europe, called SatCo. And guess what they heavily emphasized? ""Sovereignty.""** This venture aims to provide 100% cellular coverage across Europe using ASTS's satellites, designed with European control and ""sovereign backhaul capabilities"" for both commercial and government use.

See the pattern? ASTS launched a ""sovereign"" solution specifically for Europe targeting governments and critical industries, and then RIGHT after the meeting with Jeff Bezos, Amazon/AWS announces a similar sovereign solution for Europe. That doesn't just happen randomly. **To me, it screams that these companies are talking, strategizing, and probably planning to work together to create an end-to-end ""sovereign"" digital solution.**

If Amazon's secure ""Sovereign Cloud"" needs ubiquitous, reliable, and sovereign connectivity everywhere in Europe (especially where cell towers can't reach, or for emergencies), then ASTS's ""Sovereign SatCo"" is the perfect, ready-made solution. Plus, it's no secret Bezos wants to compete with Elon Musk in space. **Starlink struggles with direct-to-phone, but ASTS has that tech locked down. Starlink struggles with respecting digital sovereignty in Europe--and is even a threat to digital sovereignty after what we saw in Ukraine and Russia. ASTS has the Solution, and Jeff Bezos/Amazon/AWS want to take advantage.**

My guess? **Amazon is looking to capitalize in this blatant weakness in Elon Musk's Starlink stretegy.** Amazon will integrate ASTS's unique satellite-to-phone network into its AWS offerings, especially for these high-stakes sovereign clients. **It makes total sense for Amazon to partner with ASTS to offer a complete, end-to-end ""sovereign"" digital solution, from the cloud to your phone, anywhere in Europe.** If this happens, it's huge for ASTS and Amazon. It's bad for Elon and Starlink/SpaceX.

AAPL,StockMarket,"What To Expect in Markets This Week: June 9-13, 2025","No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expect-markets-week-may-inflation-090000203.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/expect-markets-week-may-inflation-090000203.html)

News from a tech giant, inflation data and earnings from a meme-stock legend are among the highlights of the week ahead in markets.

Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference opens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. Key companies in the growing artificial intelligence (AI) market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week.

A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump’s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows a healthy jobs report Friday.

After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500 back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs as Trump’s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” budget bill amid increasing criticism from Tesla CEO and former Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk.

# Economists Look for Inflation’s Impact in May CPI Report

Wednesday’s expected release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17.

Trump’s tariffs will be a key topic in Friday’s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months before leveling out in May. Consumers are consistently worried that tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom.

Thursday's spat included Trump telling reporters in the Oval Office he was ""disappointed"" in Musk, while Musk [argued on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1930667528696828120) — the social media platform that he owns — Trump wouldn't have won the White House without his support.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Tesla (TSLA) stock extended a two-day slide on Thursday as the very public fallout between its CEO Elon Musk and President Trump escalated.

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people,"" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. ""All of a sudden he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to have to cut the EV mandate.""

""Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. I was surprised,"" Trump added.

Tesla stock fell to session lows on Thursday afternoon as Musk reacted in real-time to Trump's comments, falling over 11% near 2:45 p.m. ET.

Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, in apparent response to Trump's comments: ""Whatever."" He continued aiming at the president and the bill in a subsequent barrage of posts over several hours.

That prompted another response from Trump, who posted on Truth Social, the platform that he owns. Trump said he ""asked"" must to leave his government post, charging that he was ""wearing thin."" He also seemed to question the purpose of Musk's department.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!"" Trump wrote.

Trump's comments amounted to an extraordinary public rebuke of Musk, who went from Trump booster and Republican Party megadonor during the 2024 campaign, to the head of the Trump-created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with a mission to cut spending.

Musk kicked off the complaints over the bill earlier this week, calling it a ""disgusting abomination"" on Tuesday. The billionaire ramped up his barbs on Wednesday, telling users on X to, ""Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.""

The Wall Street Journal also reported that the strain between the two was amplified by the White House's move to nix the nomination of Jared Isaacman for NASA administrator. Musk, a close ally of Isaacman, had advocated for him to get the job, sources told the Journal.

Bloomberg reported that Musk's ire may also be directed at the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.

The Big Beautiful Bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, with a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adding fuel to Musk's line of argument.

The nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.

DOGE itself, once led by Musk, has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find — and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.

Musk's ties to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for his broader business interests, given SpaceX's close work with NASA and regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.

But demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.

Tesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.

Meanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",838,119,2025-06-05 21:06:01

[**CRCL (Circle)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRCL&p=d)\- Watching the $100 level for potential breakout or breakdown. I regret not writing a DD for this but I was taking a break. We opened at \~2.5x multiple to the original IPO price and surged past $100 briefly in the first few minutes of trading, we've stayed pretty strong/sustained up since then. I'm interested to see if we can stay fairly at this level. I'm mainly interested in this because CRCL is one of the first listed stable C's on a US listing, and we've seen HUGE interest in recent catalysts that are related to this space/industry.

[**ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)\- ASTS surged over 13% amid speculation of a potential partnership or investment from Amazon, following social media posts featuring AST's CEO and Jeff Bezos. AMZN is beginning commercialization of its Project Kuiper initiative, a satellite-based project that will deliver retail wireless broadband to Earth (competitor to Starlink). There was a research report released that speculates ASTS's RF wireless service could complement Kuiper's broadband technology, and therefore make sense for an acquisition by AMZN. Regardless of how plausible you think an acquisition this is, this was driven all by a single picture and speculation. So be careful of volatility if nothing happens.

META,StockMarket,"US major automakers manufacturers, fearful they will have to shut down assembly lines, consider moving some parts production to China","Four major automakers are racing to find workarounds to China’s stranglehold on rare-earth magnets, which they fear could force them to shut down some car production within weeks.  


**Several traditional and electric-vehicle makers—and their suppliers—are considering shifting some auto-parts manufacturing to China** to avoid looming factory shutdowns, people familiar with the situation said.  


**Ideas under review include producing electric motors in Chinese factories or shipping made-in-America motors to China to have magnets installed.** Moving production to China as a way to get around the export controls on rare-earth magnets could work because the restrictions only cover magnets, not finished parts, the people said.  


If automakers end up shifting some production to China, it would amount to a remarkable outcome from a trade war initiated by President Trump with the intention of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.   


“If you want to export a magnet \[from China\] they won’t let you do that. If you can demonstrate that the magnet is in a motor in China, you can do that,” said a supply-chain manager at one of the carmakers.  


China in April began requiring companies to apply for permission to export magnets made with rare-earth metals, including [dysprosium and terbium](https://archive.ph/o/7xsIa/https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/dyspro-what-why-an-obscure-element-has-the-ev-industry-in-a-panic-70623bf4). The country controls roughly 90% of the world’s supply of these elements, which help magnets to operate at high temperatures. Much of the world’s modern technology, from [smartphones to F-35 jet fighters](https://archive.ph/o/7xsIa/https://www.wsj.com/business/china-rare-earth-magnets-us-production-782677e5), rely on these magnets.  


In the U.S., Ford Motor shut down production of the Ford Explorer at its Chicago plant for a week in May because of a rare-earth shortage, a spokesman said.  


Carmakers are also considering stripping out some premium features, such as adjustable seats, that make use of several tiny electric motors. High-end speaker systems that use rare-earth magnets could also be replaced with downgraded versions.

META,StockMarket,Shiny Rocks Not Stocks - Financial Repression and the Bull Case for Metals,"
THE DEBT PROBLEM

The U.S. government has a debt problem. With debt-to-GDP levels approaching those last seen during World War II, and the largest twin deficit in U.S. history, we’re borrowing the illusion of prosperity with no real path to pay it back.

Every administration since Reagan has expanded deficits and financed them with debt, all while exporting inflation to developing nations through the “King Dollar” system and exploiting cheap labor abroad.

Now, debt levels are reaching extremes. Inflation remains sticky, and government revenues can’t keep pace with rising interest payments. The conditions are ripe for a return to financial repression—and with it, a global repricing of everything.

FINANCIAL REPRESSION

Definition: Keeping interest rates (yields) below the rate of inflation in order to quietly erode the real value of debt.
Translation: Inflate your way out—without telling anyone that’s the plan.

We’ve seen this playbook before. In the post-WWII era, financial repression was used to whittle down a massive federal debt load. It worked, but only because savers took the hit, real returns were crushed, and capital was locked inside the system.

INFLATION COMES IN TWOS—AND SO DOES FINANCIAL REPRESSION

In Charts 1 and 2, you can see that every time real yields turned negative (i.e., inflation was higher than the 10-year Treasury yield), a second wave of inflation followed.

Each of these second waves saw real yields go deeper into negative territory—and commodities outperformed equities, as seen in the GOLD/SPX ratio.

We already saw the first wave in 2020. Real yields hit historic lows after the fastest rate cuts in history collided with a global economic shutdown. The Fed panicked, inflation collapsed, and markets sighed in relief. But if history’s any guide, that was just round one.

We aren’t out of the woods. The second wave is often even worse.

THE GOLD/SILVER RATIO (GSR)

The gold/silver ratio is flashing a major signal. Gold has dramatically outperformed silver, with the ratio spiking back above 100.

Historically, the GSR hasn’t spent sustained time above 97. Each time we’ve entered a second inflation wave paired with financial repression, this ratio has corrected sharply—with silver catching up violently to gold.

This setup looks eerily similar to those previous cycles. Gold has moved first. Silver may be next, but this time it’s jumping from the roof with no parachute 🪂

META,StockMarket,"The iShares Defense Industrials Active ETF (IDEF) is the BEST, most diversified defense sector ETF available, is actively managed, has the most robust and niche holdings unavailable in other defense ETFs. Read on for my assessment why if you are into defense, this should not be slept on.","One of the themes of 2025 has been Defense ETFs with the geopolitical tensions in the world today which saw the rise of Europe Defense ETFs earlier this year that diversified away from US defense ETFs. With BlackRock/iShares latest offering (IDEF), I document my reasons why I think IDEF should be a *must-have* for investors who want an ***actively managed and diversified investment in the Global defense sector.***

# Context:

* Prior to the launch of IDEF, there were only a several defense ETFs available for US investors which were also aerospace heavy (e.g. Boeing).
* The prominent ETFs which have had good performance are SHLD (Global X Defense Tech ETF) and for non-US investors, there was also DFNS (VanEck Defense UCITS ETF USD A).
* Recently, there have been EU-centric ETFs that came to prominence with the increased EU spending, such as EUAD (Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF), NATO (HANEtf The Global Defence ETF) and several others.

# The cons of the above:

1. Many of these ETFs have large concentration in aerospace companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Boeing),
2. Many of these also bloat with cybersecurity companies rather than defense companies (e.g. Crowdstrike, Palo Alto, Cisco),
3. High concentration and limited holdings. Particularly with the EU defense, you see high concentration in one to three companies (e.g. Rheinmetall, Thales, BAE, etc) which each hold an average of 10-15% weight in the portfolio, while ETFs such as DFNS are concentrated in 20-30 holdings,
4. With the prominence of Palantir, it also holds a high concentration in these ETFs of around 7-10%.

# What makes IDEF better and more well diversified:

1. It has approximately 120+ holdings, higher than any other Defense ETF,
2. The fund is actively managed, unlike majority of others which just track an index of companies thrown together to fit a theme,
3. Portfolio has exposure to South Korea, France, UK, Japan, Germany, Israel, Italy, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Singapore. The highest weight is just under 6% of all holdings (GE AEROSPACE, 5.58% as of 3 June)
4. The portfolio has the usual defense favorites such as Palantir, Thales, Rheinmetall, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and many more,
5. The portfolio also includes gems and companies that serve national defense infrastructure like Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd (Singapore - 70% YTD), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (Japan - 48% YTD), DroneShield Ltd (Australia - 117% YTD),
6. The portfolio also includes small exposures to potential high growth companies like Rocket Lab Inc, Archer Aviation, C3.ai, Redwire, Bigbear.ai,
7. Expense ratio is 0.55% which is in-line with other Defense ETFs but considered low when you consider this is actively managed compared to those that passively track an index or basket of companies.

# Downsides to the ETF:

* While this is currently the ETF which is the most diversified and has a large number of holdings, it is still US heavy at 59%.
* Being iShares/BlackRock, feels like there will always be the usual suspects such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin included.
* Current volume is low as the fund was only incepted on 19 May 2025, less than a month ago.

# How to address the downsides:

* To balance out the US heavy concentration, consider supplementing together with an EU defense ETF if you want more exposure to EU and less to US. There is no Asia/Oceanic ETF at the moment.
* To balance out the Boeing/Lockheed holdings, consider supplementing together with SHLD which does not hold these, and is arguably the 2nd best defense ETF available on the market.

Feel free to post any questions, criticisms or ask me for my opinions.

NVDA,StockMarket,Week & Month Recap: The week and month closed positively. Core PCE inflation decreased. This May was the best-performing May since 1990.,"First of all, I don't want to be misunderstood. This heat map is weekly that it reflects closing prices from May. 23 to May. 30. 

Today is the last day of the May and we've completed the week as well. So, we can discuss both of them in a single post. As mentioned in the title, May performed very good compare to long-term in May's. It was the most positive May since November 2023 with a gain of 8.92%. It also the best-performing May since 1990 with a gain of 9.19%.

Of course, these gains are closely linked to the performance in February and April, but the S&P 500 showed a strong recovery after that. The stock market continues to focus on tariff concerns which caused some volatility depending on related news. Additionally, inflation data has supported this rally so far, but the Fed has not given any positive signals yet. They continue to mark tariffs and their potential impact.

Let's take a look at the weekly and monthly closing values, and then we'll continue with this week's events.

🔸 Tuesday: Monday was a holiday, so the stock market opened on Tuesday. Last Friday, Trump said that a deal with EU could not reached and prosed a 50% tariff starting June 1. Over the weekend, he extended the deadline to July 9. Thus, the stock market started higher more than 1%. This week also was several key economic data releases. Consumer Confidence acme at 98 and its the highest level in the past 3 months. Since June 2024, this data had not dropped below 100, but it began a streak after March. It boosted the market. The S&P 500 closed more than 2% higher  and breaking 4-day losing streak. 🟢

🔸 Wednesday: The FOMC meeting minutes and $NVDA’s earnings results after the session were two key events. The stock market opened flat. In my opinion, FOMC meeting went as expected. They noted that the tariffs were larger and broader than expectations. The market didn't lose much and closed down by around 0.5%. 🔴

🔸 Thursday: After Wednesday's session, Nvidia released stronger than expected Q1 results. Before the market opened, Q1 GDP data came in slightly better than expectations. The forecast was -0.3%, but it came -0.2%. Also, the federal court blocked tariffs. However, weekly continuing jobless claims were released and reached 1,919K the highest level since October 2023. The stock market focused positive news and opened around 1% higher. As we know, tariffs are major concerns on the market. In the session, the stock market gave back some gains, but it still closed around 0.5% up. Lastly, U.S. trade team will visit India June 5-6. 🟢

🔸 Friday: Before the session, Fed's favorite economic indicator that Core PCE inflation was released. It came mounthly at 0.1% and decreased yearly from 2.6% to 2.5%. It's the lowest level since March 2021. However, Scott Bessent said trade talks between the U.S. and China have a bit stalled. As a result, the stock market opened slightly lower. During the session, The White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy said that Trump is preparing actions against China. The stock market reacted negatively at first, but later recovered and S&P 500 closed down just 0.01%. 🔴

After PCE inflation data, the earliest predicted rate cut is September 2025. However, expectations for total number of cuts in this year decreased from 3 or 4 to 2. This is not a good sign for the stock market yet. On the other hand, tariffs remain the main concern and we've been hearing both positive and negative updates. The S&P 500 has reached around 6,000 level and I believe it needs some strong positive news to break. What do you think? And how was your week?
